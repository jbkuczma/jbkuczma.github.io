									I am a 19 year old computer science major currently attending the State University of New York at Buffalo. The one thing I really enjoy about this field is when I finish writing a program, I can physically show someone and say "I made this." I am a hard working individual who always strives to do my absolute best. In my free time I am an avid photographer who focuses primarily in landscapes and long exposures, but hope to start portrait work soon. Two of my favorite cities to visit are New York City and Toronto (But I hope to travel to Chicago and San Francisco soon). Currently I work at Delta Sonic Car Wash and have been an employee there for 2 years. Being from Buffalo I am a Bills and Sabres fan even though the past few seasons have been difficult to get through, we will be back in the playoffs very soon! Since there is no hometown basketball team to follow, I am a fan of the LA Clippers, Chicago Bulls, and NY Knicks.
