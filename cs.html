				Scrabble
			</h1>
				<p class="project">
					During my Spring 2015 semester at UB I took the second half of Intro to Computer Science for Majors. A big component of this class was a team project that lasted just under three months. All teams were assigned the task of creating a Scrabble-like game with Othello scoring. We used Git to manage the syncing of our code and learned the hard way to never be working on the same piece of code as someone else at the same time. This was a great learning expereience to end my Freshman year.

				Guess My Number
			</h1>
				<p class="project">
					A simple game where the user tries guessing a number that the computer is thinking of. This game was written in Java and the range of numbers is 1-100. There are two versions of the game: one that is played within Eclipse with the console and another that can be played without an IDE.

				This website!
			</h1>
				<p class="project">
					After my freshman year I decided in order to further broaden my programming knowledge, I should take on various projects to keep my mind fresh. One idea of mine was to create a website for myself. This website will always be a work-in-progress, with new features and information coming throughout the future. Everything you see that on this page was written with Sublime Text and with the guidance of the book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189"><i>HTML & CSS, design and build websites</i> by Jon Duckett</a>.
