				Scrabble
			</h1>
				<p class="project">
					During my Spring 2015 semester at UB I took the second half of Intro to Computer Science for Majors. A big component of this class was a team project that lasted just under three months. All teams were assigned the task of creating a Scrabble-like game with Othello scoring. We used Git to manage the syncing of our code and learned the hard way to never be working on the same piece of code as someone else at the same time. This was a great learning expereience to end my Freshman year.

				Guess My Number
			</h1>
				<p class="project">
					A simple game that can be played in Eclipse where the user tries guessing the number the computer is thinking of. This was coded in Java and the range of number is 1-100 but can easily be changed to any range desired. I hope to implement this into a game that can be played outside of Eclipse.

				This website!
			</h1>
				<p class="project"> 
					After my freshman year I decided in order to not forget my programming knowledge, I shouold take on various projects to keep my mind fresh. One idea of mine was to create a website for myself. This website will always be a work-in-progress, with new features and information coming throughout the future. Otherwise, I am proud to say I now know a decent amount of HTML and CSS after this project is finished.
