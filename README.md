This website started as a static webpage that I created while teaching myself HTML and CSS. 
Seeing as we live in a mobile first world, I needed a website that was responsive and scaled to various screen sizes.

- As of November 2015, my website is now using a theme that utilizes Bootstrap.

- As of April 2016, my website is completely redesigned. I am no longer using a pre-made theme, but rather I wrote everything from scratch. It still utilizes Bootstrap.
